  # # The `has_many` below depends on the existence of

  # # you will get an error. Id the one above comes after,
  # # you will also get an error.

  # # If the name of the association (i.e. tags) is the same as
  # # the source singularized (i.e. tag) then the source can
  # # be omitted

  # # This is the Question model. We generated this file
  # # with the command:
  # # rails generate model question title:string body:text
  # # Or in general:
  # # rails generate model ModelName ColumnOneName:ColumnOneType ColumnTwoName:ColumnTwoType


  # # This command also generates a migration file in
  # # db/migrate

  # # Rail will add attr_accessors for all columns of the table (i.e. id, title, body, created_at, updated_at)

  # # Create validations by using the `validates` method.
  # # The arguments are (in order):
  # # - A column name as a symbol
  # # - Named arguments corresponding to validation rules

  # # To read more on validations, go to the following guide:
  # # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html

  #     # Be careful, the method for custom validations is
  #     # singular and its almost exactly same the method
  #     # for regular validations.

  #     # `before_validation` is a lifecycle callback method that allows us
  #     # to respond to events during the life a model instance (e.g. being validated,
  #     # being created, being updated, etc)
  #     # All lifecycle callback methods take a symbol named after a method
  #     # and calls that method at the appropriate time.

  #     # end

  #     # Scopes are such a commonly used feature that there's a way to
  #     # create them quicker. It takes a name and a lambda as a callback.

  #     # Appending an `=` to the end of a method name, allows
  #     # us to implement a `setter`. A setter is method that
  #     # is assignable.

  #     # Example
  #     # q.tag_names = "stuff, yo"

  #     # The code in the example above would call the method `tag_names`
  #     # where the value on the right hand side of the `=` would
  #     # become the argument to the method.

  #     # This is similar to adding an attr_writer.
  #     def tag_names=(rhs)
  #       self.tags = rhs.strip.split(/\s*,\s*/).map do |tag_name|

  #         # or initializes a record (Tag.new) with the attributes
  #         # if one is not found
  #         Tag.find_or_initialize_by(name: tag_name)
  #       end
